# Apollo trace

This repository contains the code to help visualise the start time, end time and duration
of Apollo Data Source calls, allowing engineers to understand where the bottlenecks are 
in their data sources.

The visualiser is hosted at [https://barringtonhaynes.github.io/apollo-trace/](https://barringtonhaynes.github.io/apollo-trace/)
